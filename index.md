# About Me
I am Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Housing in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. My areas of interest include gentrification & segregation, racial capitalism, and urban theory, especially regarding neighborhoods. My writing on these and other topics, including queerness & transness, has been published in outlets including the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and CityLab. At MIT, I teach (1) Planning Economics, (2) Housing and Social Stratification in the United States, and (3) Housing and Racial Capitalism. I use she or they pronouns.
