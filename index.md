# About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. 
My areas of interest include gentrification & segregation, racial capitalism, 
and neighborhood/transportation interrelationships. 
My writing on these and other topics, including queerness & transness, has been published in outlets including the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and CityLab. 
At MIT, I teach (1) Planning Economics and (2) Housing and Social Stratification in the 
United States. I use she or they pronouns.
