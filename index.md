# About me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. My areas of interest include gentrification & segregation, racial capitalism, and neighborhood/transportation relationships. I also write in non-academic contexts on these topics and on queerness & transness. I teach (1) Planning Economics and (2) Housing and Social Stratification in the United States. I use she or they pronouns.
