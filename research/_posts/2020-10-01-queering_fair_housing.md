abstract: "In this article, we will use queer theory to interrogate existing laws, zoning regulations, and planning and real estate practices to better understand the limits of current understanding of fair housing. We will reconceptualize ideas about identity and “protected classes,” adopting an intersectional lens; about “family” and “household,” considering nontraditional families and households; and about “housing” as it incorporates neighborhood conditions, not simply shelter, and interactions outside the market. Through this reconceptualization, we will center the
experiences of the most marginalized groups."
