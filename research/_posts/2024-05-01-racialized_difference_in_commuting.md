abstract: "How have the longer journeys to work faced by Black commuters evolved in the United States over the last four decades? Black commuters spent 49 more minutes commuting per week in 1980 than White commuters; this difference declined to 22 minutes per week in 2019. Two factors account for the majority of the difference: Black workers are more likely to commute by transit, and Black workers make up a larger share of the population in cities with long average commutes. Increases in car commuting by Black workers account for nearly one quarter of the decline in the racialized difference in commute times between 1980 and 2019. Today, commute times have mostly converged (conditional on observables) for car commuters in small- and mid-sized cities. In contrast, differential job access today drives persistent differences of commute times, particularly in large, congested, and expensive cities."

# Introduction

In 1955, Rosa Parks and five other Black women physically desegregated buses in Montgomery, AL, when they refused to give up their seats to White passengers. Parks's arrest sparked action in the local Black community, bringing local leaders together to form the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and a boycott of the buses until a more just solution was achieved.^[In fighting for their civil rights within transportation, the women entered a longstanding battleground. The landmark Supreme Court case enshrining segregation, Plessy v. Ferguson, was filed by Homer Plessy over segregated railcars (Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (U.S. Supreme Court 1896)). Fights in this arena have continued and expanded; for example, the Los Angeles Bus Riders Union filed suit over greater investment in White suburbs relative to communities of color in Greater Los Angeles (Labor/Community Strategy Center et al. v. Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation, 1996).] The year-long boycott involved many Black bus commuters: only 36% of commuters in the most segregated Black census tracts of central Montgomery commuted by car in the 1960 Census.^[By contrast, 90% of commuters in the most segregated White tracts commuted by car (see Appendix).] MIA organizers faced many challenges coordinating carpooling services for the boycotters. Montgomery was very segregated, with Black residents heavily concentrated in neighborhoods away from the mostly White neighborhoods that were closer to the jobs in the city center. Black women in particular were likely to work in domestic service, which entailed commuting to White households scattered throughout the segregated city. Meanwhile, the police sought to intimidate carpool drivers and boycott leaders by pursuing early versions of “driving while Black” policing strategies (Jeﬀerson-Jones, 2020). During a speech to the boycotters, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that Black commuters “have been inflicted with the paralysis of crippling fears on buses” and that "[this] problem has existed over endless years.”
